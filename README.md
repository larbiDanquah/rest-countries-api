### What I learned

I learned how to build an application with React and TypeScript. I also learnt how to manage state with Redux in a React application.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) ) - This helped me for as I was styling the components. It helped me save time on writing css and allow me to focus on the logic of the application.
